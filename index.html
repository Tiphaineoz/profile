        <h1> People call me Tiph</h1>  
          <p> 
            I have worked a dozen years in investment banking 🏛 as a fixed income and currencies sales. 
            For years I've been willing to get closer to the tech industry so I've finally taken the leap! 
            I resigned from my job and chose le wagon to start learning how to code. 👩‍💻 
            I'm not sure yet what's next for me, I'm just real curious to explore what else is out there.🌍 
            As they say, I plan to "trust the process and enjoy the journey". 🙈

        <h2> 🗺 Multicutural </h2>
            <p> 
              I really enjoy getting to know new culture and ways of thinking. I'm French, from the South West. I lived 8years in London 
              (I'm actually British too now) and it has now been 2 years that I live in Madrid. 
              I've also had experience in Sydney and New York as part of studies abroad experiences.
            </p>
        <h2> ✈ Love Travels and Scuba Diving </h2>
            <p> 
              As soon as I'm back from a trip I'm already thinking of organising the next one. Each trips should involve at least a day of diving, I find it so relaxing 
              and brings me so much joy.
            </p>
        <h2> 💡Lots of ideas </h2>
            <p> 
              I like to think out of the box. I'm pretty good at spotting how to save time and how to improve how to do things. I have a lot of business ideas and really hope that one of them will eventually see the light within the year.
